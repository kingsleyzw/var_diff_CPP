# vardiff
opencv implementation of the following paper:

__"Infrared small target enhancement based on variance difference"__


If you are using this code in your researches, kindly cite the following paper:

[Moradi, Saed, Payman Moallem, and Mohamad Farzan Sabahi. "A false-alarm aware methodology to develop robust and efficient multi-scale infrared small target detection algorithm." Infrared Physics & Technology 89 (2018): 387-397.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1350449517302013)

The code is implemented using OpenCV 3.4 in Ubuntu 18.04 environment. It is not tested for other OpenCV versions, but it should work. 
### Prerequisites
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

### Setup
Build OpenCV from source (if you want to enable QT option to zoom on images and see the pixels value), or just simply use the following command in terminal:

```shell
$ sudo apt install libopencv-dev python3-opencv
```
